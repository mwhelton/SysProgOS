The Offsets program dumps out the byte offsets to get from the beginning
of the major structs used in the baseline to each of their fields.
This is helpful when you need to access a field from assembly language.

Offsets is not currently set up to compile automatically because we don't
have the 32-bit sys/cdefs.h header file on our 64-bit Ubuntu systems.
I think installing gcc-multilib will fix this, but I haven't had a chance
to try it out.
